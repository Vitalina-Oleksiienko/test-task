                        <p class="slider__item-info">Thanks to the data gathered with the Plerdy heatmap about your website visitors’ behavior, you can generate hypotheses that potentially explain which functional flaws and problems are causing a low conversion on your website and how.</p>

                        <p class="slider__item-info">Some services disregard such an important aspect as the clickability analysis of the dynamic elements when UX auditing, including drop-down menu, pop-up, and slider. However, thanks to the unique Plerdy auditing functionality, you will receive this information.</p>

                        <p class="slider__item-info">In some areas, websites generate more than 60% of the traffic from their mobile versions, so it would be unwise not to audit the behavior of mobile users. With the Plerdy heatmap, you can run a UX auditing analysis separately for the desktop and mobile versions of your website.</p>
